## ðŸš§ Repo looking for a good home ðŸš§

**This addon is being poorly maintained by me and I'm out of touch with how Adobe XD is evolving. Let me know if you'd like to take ownership of this repo and addon (open an issue)**

<hr/>

# storybook-addon-xd-designs

A storybook addon that embeds 
Adobe XD specs in your addon panel for better design-development workflow.

- [Demo](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-xd-designs)

## Credit
- Forked from https://github.com/pocka/storybook-addon-designs

## Requirements

- [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)@>=6.0.0
- If you're using storybook 5... then some older versions might work... open an issue if you want me to find out which?

This addon should work well with any framework.
If not, open an issue.

## Getting started

1. Install
    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-xd-designs
    ```
    or 
    ```sh
    yarn add -D storybook-addon-xd-designs
    ```
    Make sure you have these peer dependencies installed:
    - `@storybook/addons` 
    - `@storybook/components`
    - `@storybook/theming`
    
2. Register the addon in `addons.js`
    ```js
    // .storybook/manager.js
    
    import 'storybook-addon-xd-designs/register'
    ```
3. Add your spec to the story!

    ```js
    import { withXD } from 'storybook-addon-xd-designs'
    
    storiesOf('My stories', module)
      .addDecorator(withXD)
      .add('My awesome story', () => <Button>Hello, World!</Button>, {
        design: {
          artboardUrl: 'https://xd.adobe.com/view/ae7472ea-b4ac-47c4-4eb9-7aff91446d91-d845/screen/ca95c951-f010-498f-84c6-1cf10f344616/Desktop',
        }
      })

       // Or, if it's 2019, you would have to use two urls like this:
      .add('My awesome story', () => <Button>Hello, World!</Button>, {
        design: {
          specUrl: 'https://xd.adobe.com/spec/181eaf80-9e7a-4ea6-7dc8-e21dfd9b2d80-6e2f/screen/58270c9e-502b-4737-be32-a5dfe9523bb5/Color/',
          reviewUrl: 'https://xd.adobe.com/view/813cbece-c467-47ce-67e3-b60caacc2ff8-f70d/',
        }
      })
    ```
   
## How to make and find your `spec` url.

### Circa 2020
[Detailed instructions here.](https://xd.adobe.com/view/7377f55a-1dfe-469a-64a2-8a8f8d907c01-0546/?fullscreen) 

In short, create a "Development" url to share. Then view it in a browser, find the specific page you want to use
in storybook, and copy that URL.

### Circa 2019 you had to get 2 urls
[Detailed instructions here.](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9c3f3303-01b1-444b-6615-52a130609138-ea0e/) It looks something like this:

## Usage

Add `withXD` decorator then put `design` parameter after your story.

> NOTE: If you omit `design` parameter, the addon does nothing.
